# ThymusQuantification
Segmentation and Quantification techniques using MRI.

Folder contents:

C++: automated thymus segmentation using a seed, implemented as a 3D-Slicer plug-in or standalone.

Java: ImageJ plugin for fat fraction computation.

Matlab: cluster analysis of thymus intensities.

Scripts: python and perl scripts that implement pre-processing operations, fat fraction computation, and other functions.
